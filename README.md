# MachineLearning_Newsletter
A Python application that sends daily machine learning lessons via WhatsApp using the Twilio API.

# Project Overview
This project automatically delivers bite-sized machine learning lessons on a daily basis. The system cycles through a collection of ML lessons covering topics from basic concepts to advanced techniques, sending one lesson per day.

# Features
Daily machine learning lessons sent via WhatsApp
14 different lessons covering fundamental ML concepts
Lessons include:
Descriptive content
Python code examples
Additional learning resources
Components
message_formatter.py: Formats daily lessons based on the current date
